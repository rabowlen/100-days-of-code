## Log

### R1D1 
I worked through all of the freeCodeCamp Front-End Challenges, so that I can start on the projects tomorrow.

### R1D2
I worked on the first front-end project on freeCodeCamp. I created a Tribute Page for the cartoon character Brak. The site is very silly and was pretty fun to make. I had already started this project, but was able to improve it using skills that I've learned since beginning. One project down, 29 more to go!
